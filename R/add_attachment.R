#' Add a file attachment to an email message
#'
#' This gives us a simple interface for attaching a file to the email object.
#' When it comes time to send the email through `smtp_send()`, all attachments
#' (specified by individual calls to `add_attachment()`) will be faithfully
#' transmitted along with the message.
#'
#' @inheritParams smtp_send
#' @param file_path The path for the file to be attached.
#' @param error_on_missing An option to stop with an error if the file cannot be
#'   located on disk. By default this is set to `TRUE`.
#' @param disposition Can be 'inline' or 'attachment'. Default is 'inline'.
#' @export
